# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

This project involves natural language processing (NLP) applied to a dataset of tweets related to disasters. The goal is to identify whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. The project includes data preprocessing, exploration, and analysis, utilizing common NLP techniques and machine learning models.

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates the application of natural language processing to classify disaster-related tweets. It walks through key steps such as:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, tokenization, etc.)
- Feature extraction using techniques like Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- Model training using machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation of model performance

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's Disaster Tweets Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started). It contains two main files:
- `train.csv`: A labeled dataset of 7,613 tweets with a `target` column (1 for disaster-related, 0 for non-disaster).
- `test.csv`: A test dataset for making predictions.

### Columns:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each tweet.
- **keyword**: A keyword from the tweet (may have missing values).
- **location**: The location the tweet originated from (may have missing values).
- **text**: The text of the tweet.
- **target**: Label (1 if the tweet is about a disaster, 0 otherwise).

## Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Natural language processing with disaster.ipynb**: Main Jupyter notebook that walks through the project steps.
- **train.csv** and **test.csv**: Datasets used for model training and evaluation.

## Usage
1. Download the dataset from the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started).
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `Natural language processing with disaster.ipynb` and run the cells in order.

Alternatively, if you'd like to run the notebook through a Python environment:
```bash
jupyter notebook Natural language processing with disaster.ipynb
```

## Results
The project evaluates multiple machine learning models, and key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess model performance. Visualizations and confusion matrices are included to give a better understanding of the predictions.
